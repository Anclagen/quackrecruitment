      "Graduates from colleges and working professionals in the STEM fields are the first to suffer from a talent shortage. Although STEM training affects many different industries, it poses a serious challenge for semiconductor and equipment manufacturers. While a company's regular operations won't be affected by a scarcity of STEM professionals, they may find it more difficult to recruit critical positions, replace an aging workforce, and create new products and technology. Long-term, it may slow the rate of industry growth and have an effect on the competitiveness of whole nations or regions.",

      "The shortage has a number of causes. The phenomenal expansion of well-known consumer-facing corporations like Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Netflix, according to Manocha, has contributed to the decline in education enrolment and the rise in demand for highly trained IT workers. These businesses have attracted the interest of college and high school students and diverted focus from the semiconductor industry.",
